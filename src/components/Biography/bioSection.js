   "Since his return, he took part in running the family business, established by his father in 1990 until he was handed over the responsibility of running it in 2014. As the general manager, he played a pivotal role in transforming the company into an industrial group with an important position in the local and national market, thus proving his high competency for management and business development. This encouraged him to share his experiences to promote local development projects and help his fellow compatriots create the suitable conditions for growth in order to build a better tomorrow and a better future for Algeria. Front El-Moustakbel Party was the most adequate for his own principles and goals so he joined it, running afterwards for People's Provincial Assembly elections in 2012."
